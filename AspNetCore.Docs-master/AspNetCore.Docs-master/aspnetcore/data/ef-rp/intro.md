# Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core - Tutorial 1 of 8

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra) and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

The Contoso University sample web app demonstrates how to create an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

The sample app is a web site for a fictional Contoso University. It includes functionality such as student admission, course creation, and instructor assignments. This page is the first in a series of tutorials that explain how to build the Contoso University sample app.

[Download or view the completed app.](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/data/ef-rp/intro/samples) [Download instructions](xref:index#how-to-download-a-sample).

## Prerequisites

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/net-core-prereqs-windows.md)]

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/2.1-SDK.md)]

---

Familiarity with [Razor Pages](xref:razor-pages/index). New programmers should complete [Get started with Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) before starting this series.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into a problem you can't resolve, you can generally find the solution by comparing your code to the [completed project](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/data/ef-rp/intro/samples). A good way to get help is by posting a question to [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-core) for [ASP.NET Core](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-core) or [EF Core](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/entity-framework-core).

## The Contoso University web app

The app built in these tutorials is a basic university web site.

Users can view and update student, course, and instructor information. Here are a few of the screens created in the tutorial.

![Students Index page](intro/_static/students-index.png)

![Students Edit page](intro/_static/student-edit.png)

The UI style of this site is close to what's generated by the built-in templates. The tutorial focus is on EF Core with Razor Pages, not the UI.

## Create the ContosoUniversity Razor Pages web app

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* From the Visual Studio **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**.
* Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application. Name the project **ContosoUniversity**. It's important to name the project *ContosoUniversity* so the namespaces match when code is copy/pasted.
* Select **ASP.NET Core 2.1** in the dropdown, and then select **Web Application**.

For images of the preceding steps, see [Create a Razor web app](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start#create-a-razor-pages-web-app).
Run the app.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

```CLI
dotnet new webapp -o ContosoUniversity
cd ContosoUniversity
dotnet run
```

---

## Set up the site style

A few changes set up the site menu, layout, and home page. Update *Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* with the following changes:

* Change each occurrence of "ContosoUniversity" to "Contoso University". There are three occurrences.

* Add menu entries for **Students**, **Courses**, **Instructors**, and **Departments**, and delete the **Contact** menu entry.

The changes are highlighted. (All the markup is *not* displayed.)

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu21/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml?highlight=6,29,35-38,50&name=snippet)]

In *Pages/Index.cshtml*, replace the contents of the file with the following code to replace the text about ASP.NET and MVC with text about this app:

[!code-html[](intro/samples/cu21/Pages/Index.cshtml)]

## Create the data model

Create entity classes for the Contoso University app. Start with the following three entities:

![Course-Enrollment-Student data model diagram](intro/_static/data-model-diagram.png)

There's a one-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Enrollment` entities. There's a one-to-many relationship between `Course` and `Enrollment` entities. A student can enroll in any number of courses. A course can have any number of students enrolled in it.

In the following sections, a class for each one of these entities is created.

### The Student entity

![Student entity diagram](intro/_static/student-entity.png)

Create a *Models* folder. In the *Models* folder, create a class file named *Student.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Models/Student.cs?name=snippet_Intro)]

The `ID` property becomes the primary key column of the database (DB) table that corresponds to this class. By default, EF Core interprets a property that's named `ID` or `classnameID` as the primary key. In `classnameID`, `classname` is the name of the class. The alternative automatically recognized primary key is `StudentID` in the preceding example.

The `Enrollments` property is a [navigation property](/ef/core/modeling/relationships). Navigation properties link to other entities that are related to this entity. In this case, the `Enrollments` property of a `Student entity` holds all of the `Enrollment` entities that are related to that `Student`. For example, if a Student row in the DB has two related Enrollment rows, the `Enrollments` navigation property contains those two `Enrollment` entities. A related `Enrollment` row is a row that contains that student's primary key value in the `StudentID` column. For example, suppose the student with ID=1 has two rows in the `Enrollment` table. The `Enrollment` table has two rows with `StudentID` = 1. `StudentID` is a foreign key in the `Enrollment` table that specifies the student in the `Student` table.

If a navigation property can hold multiple entities, the navigation property must be a list type, such as `ICollection<T>`. `ICollection<T>` can be specified, or a type such as `List<T>` or `HashSet<T>`. When `ICollection<T>` is used, EF Core creates a `HashSet<T>` collection by default. Navigation properties that hold multiple entities come from many-to-many and one-to-many relationships.

### The Enrollment entity

![Enrollment entity diagram](intro/_static/enrollment-entity.png)

In the *Models* folder, create *Enrollment.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Models/Enrollment.cs?name=snippet_Intro)]

The `EnrollmentID` property is the primary key. This entity uses the `classnameID` pattern instead of `ID` like the `Student` entity. Typically developers choose one pattern and use it throughout the data model. In a later tutorial, using ID without classname is shown to make it easier to implement inheritance in the data model.

The `Grade` property is an `enum`. The question mark after the `Grade` type declaration indicates that the `Grade` property is nullable. A grade that's null is different from a zero grade -- null means a grade isn't known or hasn't been assigned yet.

The `StudentID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Student`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Student` entity, so the property contains a single `Student` entity. The `Student` entity differs from the `Student.Enrollments` navigation property, which contains multiple `Enrollment` entities.

The `CourseID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Course`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Course` entity.

EF Core interprets a property as a foreign key if it's named `<navigation property name><primary key property name>`. For example,`StudentID` for the `Student` navigation property, since the `Student` entity's primary key is `ID`. Foreign key properties can also be named `<primary key property name>`. For example, `CourseID` since the `Course` entity's primary key is `CourseID`.

### The Course entity

![Course entity diagram](intro/_static/course-entity.png)

In the *Models* folder, create *Course.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Models/Course.cs?name=snippet_Intro)]

The `Enrollments` property is a navigation property. A `Course` entity can be related to any number of `Enrollment` entities.

The `DatabaseGenerated` attribute allows the app to specify the primary key rather than having the DB generate it.

## Scaffold the student model

In this section, the student model is scaffolded. That is, the scaffolding tool produces pages for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the student model.

* Build the project.
* Create the *Pages/Students* folder.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* In **Solution Explorer**, right click on the *Pages/Students* folder > **Add** > **New Scaffolded Item**.
* In the **Add Scaffold** dialog, select **Razor Pages using Entity Framework (CRUD)** > **ADD**.

Complete the **Add Razor Pages using Entity Framework (CRUD)** dialog:

* In the **Model class** drop-down, select **Student (ContosoUniversity.Models)**.
* In the **Data context class** row, select the **+** (plus) sign and change the generated name to **ContosoUniversity.Models.SchoolContext**.
* In the **Data context class** drop-down,  select **ContosoUniversity.Models.SchoolContext**
* Select **Add**.

![CRUD dialog](intro/_static/s1.png)

See [Scaffold the movie model](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/model#scaffold-the-movie-model) if you have a problem with the preceding step.

# [.NET Core CLI](#tab/netcore-cli)

Run the following commands to scaffold the student model.

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design --version 2.1.0
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator razorpage -m Student -dc ContosoUniversity.Models.SchoolContext -udl -outDir Pages/Students --referenceScriptLibraries
```

---

The scaffold process created and changed the following files:

### Files created

* *Pages/Students* Create, Delete, Details, Edit, Index.
* *Data/SchoolContext.cs*

### File updates

* *Startup.cs* : Changes to this file are detailed in the next section.
* *appsettings.json* : The connection string used to connect to a local database is added.

## Examine the context registered with dependency injection

ASP.NET Core is built with [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection). Services (such as the EF Core DB context) are registered with dependency injection during application startup. Components that require these services (such as Razor Pages) are provided these services via constructor parameters. The constructor code that gets a db context instance is shown later in the tutorial.

The scaffolding tool automatically created a DB Context and registered it with the dependency injection container.

Examine the `ConfigureServices` method in *Startup.cs*. The highlighted line was added by the scaffolder:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Startup.cs?name=snippet_SchoolContext&highlight=13-14)]

The name of the connection string is passed in to the context by calling a method on a [DbContextOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontextoptions) object. For local development, the [ASP.NET Core configuration system](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) reads the connection string from the *appsettings.json* file.

## Update main

In *Program.cs*, modify the `Main` method to do the following:

* Get a DB context instance from the dependency injection container.
* Call the  [EnsureCreated](/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.infrastructure.databasefacade.ensurecreated#Microsoft_EntityFrameworkCore_Infrastructure_DatabaseFacade_EnsureCreated).
* Dispose the context when the `EnsureCreated` method completes.

The following code shows the updated *Program.cs* file.

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Program.cs?name=snippet)]

`EnsureCreated` ensures that the database for the context exists. If it exists, no action is taken. If it does not exist, then the database and all its schema are created. `EnsureCreated` does not use migrations to create the database. A database that is created with `EnsureCreated` cannot be later updated using migrations.

`EnsureCreated` is called on app start, which allows the following work flow:

* Delete the DB.
* Change the DB schema (for example, add an `EmailAddress` field).
* Run the app.
* `EnsureCreated` creates a DB with the`EmailAddress` column.

`EnsureCreated` is convenient early in development when the schema is rapidly evolving. Later in the tutorial the DB is deleted and migrations are used.

### Test the app

Run the app and accept the cookie policy. This app doesn't keep personal information. You can read about the cookie policy at [EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) support](xref:security/gdpr).

* Select the **Students** link and then **Create New**.
* Test the Edit, Details, and Delete links.

## Examine the SchoolContext DB context

The main class that coordinates EF Core functionality for a given data model is the DB context class. The data context is derived from [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontext). The data context specifies which entities are included in the data model. In this project, the class is named `SchoolContext`.

Update *SchoolContext.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Data/SchoolContext.cs?name=snippet_Intro&highlight=12-14)]

The highlighted code creates a [DbSet\<TEntity>](/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbset-1) property for each entity set. In EF Core terminology:

* An entity set typically corresponds to a DB table.
* An entity corresponds to a row in the table.

`DbSet<Enrollment>` and `DbSet<Course>` could be omitted. EF Core includes them implicitly because the `Student` entity references the `Enrollment` entity, and the `Enrollment` entity references the `Course` entity. For this tutorial, keep `DbSet<Enrollment>` and `DbSet<Course>` in the `SchoolContext`.

### SQL Server Express LocalDB

The connection string specifies [SQL Server LocalDB](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-2016-express-localdb). LocalDB is a lightweight version of the SQL Server Express Database Engine and is intended for app development, not production use. LocalDB starts on demand and runs in user mode, so there's no complex configuration. By default, LocalDB creates *.mdf* DB files in the `C:/Users/<user>` directory.

## Add code to initialize the DB with test data

EF Core creates an empty DB. In this section, an `Initialize` method is written to populate it with test data.

In the *Data* folder, create a new class file named *DbInitializer.cs* and add the following code:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Data/DbInitializer.cs?name=snippet_Intro)]

Note: The preceding code uses `Models` for the namespace (`namespace ContosoUniversity.Models`) rather than `Data`. `Models` is consistent with the scaffolder-generated code. For more information, see [this GitHub scaffolding issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Scaffolding/issues/822).

The code checks if there are any students in the DB. If there are no students in the DB, the DB is initialized with test data. It loads test data into arrays rather than `List<T>` collections to optimize performance.

The `EnsureCreated` method automatically creates the DB for the DB context. If the DB exists, `EnsureCreated` returns without modifying the DB.

In *Program.cs*, modify the `Main` method to call `Initialize`:

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Program.cs?name=snippet2&highlight=14-15)]

Delete any student records and restart the app. If the DB is not initialized, set a break point in `Initialize` to diagnose the problem.

## View the DB

The database name is generated from the context name you provided earlier plus a dash and a GUID. Thus, the database name will be "SchoolContext-{GUID}". The GUID will be different for each user.
Open **SQL Server Object Explorer** (SSOX) from the **View** menu in Visual Studio.
In SSOX, click **(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB > Databases > SchoolContext-{GUID}**.

Expand the **Tables** node.

Right-click the **Student** table and click **View Data** to see the columns created and the rows inserted into the table.

## Asynchronous code

Asynchronous programming is the default mode for ASP.NET Core and EF Core.

A web server has a limited number of threads available, and in high load situations all of the available threads might be in use. When that happens, the server can't process new requests until the threads are freed up. With synchronous code, many threads may be tied up while they aren't actually doing any work because they're waiting for I/O to complete. With asynchronous code, when a process is waiting for I/O to complete, its thread is freed up for the server to use for processing other requests. As a result, asynchronous code enables server resources to be used more efficiently, and the server is enabled to handle more traffic without delays.

Asynchronous code does introduce a small amount of overhead at run time. For low traffic situations, the performance hit is negligible, while for high traffic situations, the potential performance improvement is substantial.

In the following code, the [async](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async) keyword, `Task<T>` return value, `await` keyword, and `ToListAsync` method make the code execute asynchronously.

[!code-csharp[](intro/samples/cu21/Pages/Students/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_ScaffoldedIndex)]

* The `async` keyword tells the compiler to:
  * Generate callbacks for parts of the method body.
  * Automatically create the [Task](/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task) object that's returned. For more information, see [Task Return Type](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/async-return-types#BKMK_TaskReturnType).

* The implicit return type `Task` represents ongoing work.
* The `await` keyword causes the compiler to split the method into two parts. The first part ends with the operation that's started asynchronously. The second part is put into a callback method that's called when the operation completes.
* `ToListAsync` is the asynchronous version of the `ToList` extension method.

Some things to be aware of when writing asynchronous code that uses EF Core:

* Only statements that cause queries or commands to be sent to the DB are executed asynchronously. That includes, `ToListAsync`, `SingleOrDefaultAsync`, `FirstOrDefaultAsync`, and `SaveChangesAsync`. It doesn't include statements that just change an `IQueryable`, such as `var students = context.Students.Where(s => s.LastName == "Davolio")`.
* An EF Core context isn't thread safe: don't try to do multiple operations in parallel.
* To take advantage of the performance benefits of async code, verify that library packages (such as for paging) use async if they call EF Core methods that send queries to the DB.

For more information about asynchronous programming in .NET, see [Async Overview](/dotnet/standard/async) and [Asynchronous programming with async and await](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/).

In the next tutorial, basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations are examined.
